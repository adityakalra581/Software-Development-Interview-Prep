## Hash Map or Hash Table

- In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract
data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

- A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets
or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

- Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket.

- But most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions
where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. 

- Such collisions are always accommodated in some way.
